## Mission objectives

- Be able to work and process data from audio format
- Find insights from data, build hypothesis and define conclusions
- Build machine learning models for predictive classification and/or regression
- Select the right performance metrics for your model
- Evaluate the distribution of datapoints and evaluate its influence in the model
- Be able to identify underfitting or overfitting that might exist on the model
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance
- Select the model with better performance and following your
  customer's requirements
- Define the strengths and limitations of the model


## About The Repository

This is a project about developing a machine learning model that is able to monitor the operations and identify anomalies audio sounds of the equipment.

The implementation of this model can allow the clients to operate the manufacturing equipment at full capacity and detect signs of failure before the damage is so critical that the production line has to be stopped.

## Libraries Used For This Project

**Pandas** https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
  - Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.
  - In this project, pandas is used to read the csv files as a dataframe.


**Time** https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html
  - Time module handles time-related tasks.
  - In this project, time is used to calculate the total time the code runs.


**Typing** https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
  - Typing defines a standard notation for Python function and variable type annotations.
  - In this project, typing is used to help document the code properly.
